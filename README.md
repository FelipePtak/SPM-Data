# SPM-Data

Just a few Matlab functions used to analyze SPM data from a MultiMode Nanoscope IIIa and JPK NanoWizard.

Functions include reading MultiMode images as binary files and JPK images in .txt files, data fitting to contact models (DMT and JKR) using adhesion both as a free parameter and as a fixed parameter from experimental measurement and further data analysis and plots.
